# MeGraPDE

MeGraPDE stands for MetricGraphPDEs and implements numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) on metric graphs. I have developed the MeGraPDE.jl package in connection with my Ph.D thesis at the University of Cologne \[W\].

## Documentation

Full documentation and first usage examples are available at https://annaweller.github.io/MeGraPDE.jl/

## Info

Among others, the package includes

  - construction of a variety of exemplary metric graphs and test problems
  - discretization via extended graphs
  - finite element solver for PDEs on metric graphs, e.g. in combination with a multigrid approach
  - computation of quantum graph eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
  - spectral Galerkin solver for PDEs on metric graphs, e.g. in combination with a filon-quadrature

The package relies on the methods from [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) for combinatorial graphs.

The finite element discretization via extended graphs is implemented based on the original work \[AB\].
The computation of equilateral quantum graph eigenvalues is based on an idea originally proposed by von Below \[B\].
The remaining methods and the related theory have been derived for \[W\] and are discussed therein.

The package is under continuous development.
